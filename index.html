		The driver’s suit of <span style="font-size:20px;">Sky Titan – Premium Version, created by IDAI (Imagine the Directions of Artificial Intelligence)</span>, is designed as a living extension of the vehicle.

	<br><br><br><h2>Titan’s Covenant: The Essential Armor of Sky Titan</h2><br><br>

	<p>
		<span>A Vehicle Beyond Boundaries</span><br>
		Sky Titan is not just a machine—it is a symbol of humanity’s future. It breaks the limits of crowded roads, unreachable skies, and the depths of the ocean. With Sky Titan, people are no longer confined to one place; they can move freely across land, sky, and sea. It represents safety, freedom, and connection, transforming human life by reaching places ordinary vehicles cannot—remote villages, storm‑struck regions, or deep‑sea missions.<br><br><br>

		<span>The Human Extension</span><br>
		To match such colossal strength, the driver requires more than ordinary clothing. The suit, named Titan’s Covenant, is conceived as a living extension of Sky Titan itself. Where the vehicle embodies courage and guardianship, the suit translates that essence into human form.<br><br><br>

		<span>Design and Symbolism</span><br>
		The suit’s foundation is a fusion of red and blue armor—red for valor and determination, blue for serenity and infinite vision. Its plating shields the body yet remains fluid, allowing the driver to move with grace inside the cockpit. Luminous veins across the chest and arms mirror the Titan’s energy channels, reminding that man and machine are bound in covenant.<br><br>

		At the heart of the suit rests an emblem, pressed close to the wearer’s spirit. This emblem is not decoration but a seal of vows: mastery of craft, charity toward others, faith and God‑consciousness, and holistic care for family and society.<br><br>

		<span>Importance and Benefits</span><br>
		The suit is more than protection—it is a declaration of values. It ensures physical safety while reinforcing moral responsibility. In dangerous missions, it guards the driver; in peaceful journeys, it symbolizes trust and stewardship. By wearing Titan’s Covenant, the driver steps into a role larger than the self, carrying the weight of vows and the light of faith.<br><br><br>

		<span>The Driver’s Oath</span><br>
		Sky Titan expands human imagination, and Titan’s Covenant ensures that its driver embodies the same courage and responsibility. Together, they represent a future where technology and humanity move as one—breaking limits, protecting lives, and bringing the promise of tomorrow closer.

	<h3>Titan’s Covenant – Helmet</h3>
	<p> 

		The helmet is envisioned as the crown of protection, merging futuristic technology with symbolic guardianship. Forged from polished golden alloy and armored plating, it radiates durability and resilience. Its angular yet smooth contours recall advanced military and space‑suit design, projecting both elegance and strength.  <br><br>

		From the eyes emanates a luminous blue glow, serving as a Head‑Up Display that delivers vital information to the wearer. This light is more than technology—it is a cybernetic vision, guiding the driver with clarity in both battlefields and explorations. The glow symbolizes wisdom and serenity, ensuring that courage is always tempered by insight.  <br><br>

		Dark panels and subtle grooves across the helmet conceal intricate systems: communication arrays, ventilation channels, and sensory enhancements. These hidden elements transform the helmet into a living interface, connecting man and machine seamlessly.  <br><br>

		Inspired by legendary armor aesthetics yet distinct in its own identity, the helmet grants the wearer extraordinary capability. In the imagined world of Sky Titan, it is not only a shield against danger but a beacon of responsibility. To don this helmet is to step into a covenant of protection, embodying strength, vision, and faith while venturing into the unknown realms of sky and sea.  <br><br>

	<h3>Titan’s Covenant – Crown</h3>
	<p>
		The crown of Titan’s Covenant is envisioned not as a symbol of mischief, but as a transformation of that archetype into guardianship. Forged in radiant gold, it carries the aura of authority and sacred responsibility. Its structure resembles a headband, strengthened with durable materials to ensure resilience and adaptability, fitting securely to the wearer’s form. <br><br>

		At the front lies a subtle V‑shaped design, sharp yet regal, signifying vision and victory. Rising from its edges are two curved horns, echoing ancient emblems of power. In this suit, however, the horns are reimagined—not as chaos, but as balance between strength and wisdom. They stand as reminders that true guardianship requires both courage and restraint. <br><br>

		The crown integrates seamlessly with the rest of the armor, completing the covenant between driver and Sky Titan. It is not merely ornamental; it is a ritual seal upon the head, binding thought and spirit to the vows of stewardship. To wear this crown is to accept the mantle of responsibility, to lead with clarity, and to embody the courage that Sky Titan represents. Thus, the crown becomes the suit’s spiritual apex—an emblem of vision, guardianship, and the sacred bond between humanity and its future.

	<h3>Titan’s Covenant – Main Body</h3>
	<p>
		The main body of 'Titan’s Covenant', envisioned as the living core of the suit, radiates both technological mastery and symbolic strength. Forged in bronze and golden metallic armor, its surface gleams with resilience, while streams of neon‑blue light run across the plating like veins of electricity. These luminous lines give the suit a futuristic, cyberpunk aura, binding the driver to the energy of Sky Titan itself.  <br><br>

		At the center of the chest shines a majestic lion emblem, sculpted in gold. The lion embodies courage and guardianship, its presence reminding the wearer of vows to protect and lead. Surrounding the emblem, blue light pulses outward, and beneath it glows the name IDAI, inscribed in white—a declaration of the suit’s origin and covenant with its creator.  <br><br>

		The shoulders and upper arms integrate advanced interfaces: glowing HUD panels and data displays that provide real‑time information. In the wearer’s palms, radiant cubes of blue and orange hover like holographic data blocks, symbolizing control over knowledge and power.  <br><br>

		Altogether, the body of Titan’s Covenant is not merely armor but a ritualized core—melding strength, technology, and symbolism into a single living extension of Sky Titan, empowering the driver with protection, vision, and responsibility.

	<h3>Titan’s Covenant – Super Arm</h3>
	<p>
		The super arm of Titan’s Covenant is engineered as both weapon and instrument, merging raw strength with precise control. Forged from golden‑bronze alloy, its surface gleams with resilience, while neon‑blue light lines trace across every joint and edge, marking the flow of advanced energy systems.<br><br>

		The fingers are mechanical yet muscular in design, capable of delicate movements as well as powerful grips. This duality ensures the wearer can perform intricate tasks with precision while unleashing immense force when needed. The arm is not merely robotic—it is a covenant of mastery, embodying the balance between finesse and strength.<br><br>

		In the palm hovers a radiant blue cube hologram, glowing with intense light. This digital construct represents knowledge, data, and control—an interface through which the driver commands Sky Titan’s systems or channels energy outward. The cube’s brilliance symbolizes the fusion of human will and artificial intelligence, turning the arm into a living conduit of power and responsibility.<br><br>

		Thus, the super arm is more than armor. It is a declaration of agency—an extension of the driver’s vow to protect, create, and command with wisdom.

	<h3>Titan’s Covenant – Lion Emblem</h3>
	<p>
		The lion emblem at the chest of Titan’s Covenant is the suit’s beating heart, a radiant symbol of courage and authority. Set within a deep navy circle bordered by thick gold, the design immediately conveys power and nobility.<br><br>

		At the top of the circle roars a fierce lion’s head, its mane and inner features glowing in vivid red. The open mouth, golden teeth, and piercing golden eyes embody strength, bravery, and an unyielding spirit—reminding the wearer that leadership demands both ferocity and guardianship.<br><br>

		Beneath the lion rests the name IDAI, inscribed in bold golden letters. This inscription ties the emblem directly to its creator, marking the suit as a covenant between human responsibility and technological vision.<br><br>

		Altogether, the emblem is more than decoration. It is a declaration of identity, a seal of vows, and a beacon of fearless leadership. To wear it is to embody the lion’s roar—courageous, protective, and unafraid to face the unknown.

	<h3>Titan’s Covenant – Cybernetic Legs</h3>
	<p>
		The legs of Titan’s Covenant are engineered as pillars of strength, designed to carry the driver across land, sky, and sea with unwavering stability. From the upper thigh down to the ankle, heavy golden‑bronze plating shields the body, embodying resilience and protection.<br><br>

		Across the joints and knees run luminous neon‑blue energy lines, glowing like veins of power. On the right knee sits a rectangular display panel, projecting real‑time data about the suit’s condition. On the left leg, a long vertical streak of blue light descends from knee to ankle, symbolizing the flow of controlled energy.<br><br>

		Surrounding effects intensify the aura: orange and red flames flicker beneath, hinting at high‑temperature propulsion or energy discharge, while sparks of blue electricity flash at the side, marking the suit’s advanced cybernetic systems.<br><br>

		The design is muscular and angular, balancing mobility with maximum defense. These legs are not only armor but engines of movement—empowering the wearer to stride with confidence, leap with precision, and stand as an unshakable guardian in the covenant of Sky Titan.

	<h3>Titan’s Covenant - Super Shoe</h3>

	<p>
		The super shoes of Titan’s Covenant are designed as engines of speed and agility, merging futuristic aesthetics with advanced propulsion technology. Their sleek form begins with a smooth silver‑white front, flowing into a bold black midsection and heel. This contrast creates a striking aerodynamic profile, emphasizing motion and balance.<br><br>

		Unlike traditional footwear, the shoes are laceless and seamless, built for maximum efficiency.
